BUGS:
> if you hit the next/prev keys too fast they stay in the same image
> if you hit the next/prev keys too fast you see a glimpse of the stack in the back
> if you click second name, and scroll up, the end wont be in the middle
> current scroll is stalling or something, getting stuck along the way
