BUGS:
>> scrolling should be disabled when expanded (should not break the next/prev key pressing)
> if you hit the next/prev keys too fast they stay in the same image
> there a small wobble effect on the expanded image when pressing next/prev keys
> when expanded, hover lift seems to remain in effect at the wrong location (where it was before expanding)
